Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

## Random Drawing Generator

The website is a generator that creates a 3D image using multiple triangles. The User inputs the number of vertices (number of points) and the number of triangles to draw. It randomly generates the (x, y, z) coordinates for a specificed number of points and draws the specificed number of triangles from randomly picked points. The last input is for giving the creation a name. 

Include a very brief summary of your project here.
Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
